# Deep-Graph-Clustering-of-Spatial-Transcriptomics-in-a-Mouse-Brain
Applied deep graph clustering (GCN, GAT, AGC, DFCN, GALA) on 10x Visium mouse brain data to identify spatially coherent tissue domains and communication hubs. Used PCA, k-NN graphs, DGI, and silhouette scores to evaluate clustering quality. Results aligned with known brain regions and marker genes.
